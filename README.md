# Dungeon_Dudes
Unity game. 

** BASIC GUIDELINES **

- Ideally the script only manages one thing. can be a single function or a single system. 
- Sign and comment each script
- if they are player or npc specific the script name should reflect it.

examples:  
- wallDetection - detects when any player or NPC collides with wall
- playerDoorDetection - detects when the player is colliding with door, and controls player/door interaction.
- playerHealth -  only manages player health
- takeDamage - can work on player / enemy / npc / animal

- use best judgement, just write a comment to explain why you did what you did if you are unsure
- dont delete scripts, and DO NOT rename scripts, make new ones and manually change them.

** Add to README to add more rules.
